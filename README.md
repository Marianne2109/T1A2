## Functionality & Features
The functionalities and features of this portfolio are:
* Design: I developed this website using a mobile fisrt approach. With a minimalist design and simple layout and a earthy/neutral colour palette to reflect a sense of calmness and simplicity. I used semantic elements throughout and alt text description for images considering screenreaders. These carachteristics make the website itself accessible.

* Structure: The webiste is structured to have multiples pages linked to the navigation bar in the header. The pages include:
  * home page - this is the landing page and it includes a button "read more" linking to the about page
  * about - to provide some more information about myself in relation to my background, education and hobbies
  * skills - content combining skills and portfolio, with placeholders for future content
  * blog - a space to project some of my topics of interest and connect with the target audience 
  * contact - indicating the different avenues to connect with me
* Features: To showcase the intended content while keeping in mind an engaging design that inline with simplicity, I used cards for blogs and skills. Button linking pages within the website and simple colour animations to highlight certain elements and content. 

## Sitemap
I initialy drew a sitemap with pen and paper. The structure was the same from the start however I did return to my initial design and did some changes and additions such as the buttons to improve the flow between pages and combining skills and projects under the skills page.

## Wireframes
Similar to sitemap, I initially sketch things on paper. These wireframes are low fidelity, they show the general structure and overall placement of elements.
The initial sketch was very similar to my end result, as I aimed for a simple layout that was achievable and responsive. However, along the way I made changes in areas where improvement was needed for flow and accessibility,

## The Outcome 
Overall I am quite happy with the end result. I would have not been able to create a website from scratch just a couple of weeks ago. I intend to keep this site up to date along the way. 
Next are some screenshots of each page.
Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
