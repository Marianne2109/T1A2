The functionalities and features of this portfolio are:

        - contact - indicating the different avenues to connect with me
- Features: To showcase the intended content while keeping in mind an engaging design that inline with simplicity, I used cards for blogs and skills. Button linking pages within the website and simple colour animations to highlight certain elements and content.
