            <h3>Hello, I'm Marianne</h3>

            <section class="about-p">
            <p>I like learning new things and taking on new challenges. I’m originally from Patagonia in the south of Chile, right now I’m based in Melbourne. 
My background is not related to tech. I’m trained as a Physiotherapist though I’ve worked in a variety of industries. I’ve travelled extensively and lived in different countries. Adaptability is part of my essence. 

On a personal level, the past three years have been the most challenging yet rewarding to date. I became a mum of two girls. I decided to show my girls that we can do hard things, like pursuing a new career. I’m currently a web development student at Coder Academy and I’m determined to give my absolute best and conquer this new challenge.
