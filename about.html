            <h3>Hi, It's me ðŸ‘‹ Marianne</h3>

            <div class="about-p">
                <p>I like learning new things and taking on new challenges. Iâ€™m originally from Patagonia in the south
                    of Chile, right now Iâ€™m based in Melbourne.
                    My background is not related to tech. Iâ€™m trained as a Physiotherapist though Iâ€™ve worked in a
                    variety of industries. Iâ€™ve travelled extensively and lived in different countries. Adaptability is
                    part of my essence.

                    On a personal level, the past three years have been the most challenging yet rewarding to date. I
                    became a mum of two girls. I decided to show my girls that we can do hard things, like pursuing a
                    new career. Iâ€™m currently a web development student at Coder Academy and Iâ€™m determined to give my
                    absolute best and conquer this new challenge.
